# ckbcvdrisk
Stata Program that calculates 10-year risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its three main subcategories (ischemic heart disease[IHD], ischemic stroke[IS], and hemorrhagic stroke[HS]) using the "CKB-CVD models".
The predictors included in the CKB-CVD models are: sex, age, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), use of blood pressure-lowering treatment, current daily smoker, history of diabetes, and waist circumference.
This program also recalibrates the predicted risks using the user-defined recalibration parameters.
For details, please see the help file (ckbcvdrisk.hlp)
The ckbcvdrisk.ado program has mainly been developed to facilitate calculation and further evaluation of the "CKB-CVD models". Details of the methods and results
are described in our paper:
